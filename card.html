			<p>Sharks have been around for hundreds of millions of years and are among the deadliest creatures on Earth. Sharks can unhinge their jaws and destroy large prey with their rows of razor sharp teeth. But even though sharks' jaws and teeth make them fierce predators, it's their sensory perception that truly makes them great hunters.</p>
